Instructions [here](http://pybit.es/codechallenge01.html).

Previous challenges and About [here](http://pybit.es/pages/challenges.html).

In order to improve my python skills I've decided to take on some of these challenges. 
If I am completing these 'tasks' in the 'wrong' way, or with the 'wrong' type of workflow
please correct me. 

As ever I am always open to suggestion, comment and constructive critisim. 

My solution is two fold, I give the user a chance to test a system with five
words that they choose themselves. The user is then given the choice to see
what top three words are contained with the dictionary.
